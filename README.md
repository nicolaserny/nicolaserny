# Hej

I'm Nicolas. I love coding and building things (but also traveling, dreaming, and taking [photos](https://photonicolas.com/)).

> My mojo: "Never stop learning. Just think for a second: the universe is so huge and life so short. I'm pretty sure a new idea is just around the corner."

I work at [Invivoo](https://www.invivoo.com) as a software engineer in Paris, France. For more information about me, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NicolasErny). 

Check out my latest [personal project](https://github.com/nicolaserny/yoga-by-delphine): [YogaByDelphine](https://yogabydelphine.com/) is a website to book yoga courses.
