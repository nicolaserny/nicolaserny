# Hey, I'm Nicolas 👏

I love coding, building things, and I'm a Neovim enthusiast.

Beyond the screen, I'm drawn to the call of the wild: traveling, hiking, and cross-country skiing. I also find joy in dreaming and capturing moments through [photography](https://photonicolas.com/).

I’m always working to improve myself and expand my knowledge.

> My philosophy: "Never stop learning. Consider this: the universe is vast, life is short, and I believe a new idea is always just around the corner."

I work at [Invivoo](https://www.invivoo.com) as a lead developer and technical architect in Paris, France.
